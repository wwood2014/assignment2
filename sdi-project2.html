    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<article>
<p>I chose this theme because it has something to do with my job on a day to day basis. My job plays a very important role when it comes to emergencies.</p>
<p>This story was about a 2 year old child that was found lying face down in a pool not breathing by his mother. I chose this story because it shows many decision points and many actions as well. I also chose this story to help with educating the public how important it is to listen to a Public Safety Telecommunicator when you're on the phone with them, because if you don't know what to do in an emergency situation they can walk you through it.</p>
<p>I would say that knowing what to expect when you call 9-1-1 is very important and everyone should learn more about it.</p>
